systemd Secure boot integration
===============================
This software automatically installs systemd-boot and kernels for it into the
ESP, signed with keys generated by it.

SECURITY
--------
The keys are stored unencrypted and only protected by the file system
permissions. Thus, you should make sure that the file system they are
stored in is encrypted.

Configuration
-------------
Kernel commandline can be placed in /etc/kernel/cmdline.

Limitations
-----------
* Only amd64/x64/x86_64 is supported for now
* Kernels and initramfs images must be named /boot/vmlinuz-<ver> and
  /boot/initrd.img-<ver>
* Only a single ESP is supported which must be mounted in /boot/efi
* Key generation is not done yet.


Integrating with your package management
----------------------------------------
See the debian/ packaging for an example. Basically, whenever the systemd-boot
file is updated, run jak-sb bootctl update. And whenever is dracut invoked
in some way to build an initramfs, run jak-sb install-kernel afterwards.
